# webterminal

#### See demo: https://lucacostanzi.github.io/webterminal/

You can use any of the commands listed here. The words inside the square brackets are parameters that can be added to the command. 

ie: CD stands for CHANGE DIRECTORY and accepts a [path] parameter. 

Let's assume that you are in the starting folder C: and use the command DIR to find out there is a subfolder called "documents" (you know it's a folder and not a file because it's showed next to the word DIR). 
You can type the following command and press enter to open it:
cd documents 
The command line will now show the new current directory: 
C:\documents> 

To return on the parent folder C: you can now use the command CD.. (CD followed by 2 points).
